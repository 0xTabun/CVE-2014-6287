You can get reverse shell with .sh file (in Linux)<br>
You can get reverse shell with .py file in (Windows and Linux) (in windows, you need to install netcat)<br>

You must specify the url<br>

example: http://target.com/<br>

* using for .py:<br>
python exploit.py<br>

##### Exploit Title: CVE-2014-6287 | Reverse shell for (Rejetto http File Server 2.3.x)<br>
***Author: Tabun***
<br>
# POC part 1 (without exploit):
![terminal](https://github.com/0xTabun/CVE-2014-6287/assets/144548207/0f80ea07-ea67-4e20-b397-aa17b9329ad3)
1. To use this vulnerability, we first need a powershell reverse shell. As you can see,<br>
   we converted it to "UTF-16LE" format with the iconv tool and parse it as hexadecimal with the xxd tool.
   
3. We can take a long look at this with xxd, but we need the raw hex code,<br>
   so we converted it to "UTF-16LE" format again and we got raw hex codes using the hexdump tool.
   
5. Finally, we converted the raw hex codes into our part of payload with base64 encode (xxd and base64 were used)<br>
# POC part 2 (without exploit):
![burp](https://github.com/0xTabun/CVE-2014-6287/assets/144548207/02fdeaee-9ae7-468c-9c02-de79d2642f8c)
1. Using ?search with %00, we specified the Powershell path,<br>
   entered the base64 code and break the system with netcat.
